# process-scheduler-simulator
A small scheduler simulator to help compare efficiencies of common scheduling methods and effects of time quantum on performances of wait and processing times. Will be implementing priority queues in a future iteration.

## Usage

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Ozzcer/process-scheduler-simulator.git
cd process-scheduler-simulator
python run.py
```

## Currently modelled scheduling methods:
